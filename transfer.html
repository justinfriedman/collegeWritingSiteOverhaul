  <h1>Transfer Student Portfolio</h1>
  <p><i>
    This process applies to all students except those transferring into Engineering; Engineering students should contact the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at 314-935-5463.

</i>
  </p>
  <h3>First-Year Writing Requirement</h3>
  <p>
    All students at Washington University must satisfy a first-year writing requirement; most do so by taking College Writing 1(L59 100).  If you have not taken an equivalent course at your previous college or university, you must take College Writing 1 during your first year of study. If you have taken an equivalent course, you may be eligible to submit a Writing Portfolio, which will help us to determine whether or not you are required to take another writing course. Note: Students who transfer in as freshmen are not eligible for portfolio submission.


  </p>
  <hr />
  <h3>Portfolio Eligibility</h3>
  <p>


    To find out whether you are eligible to submit a portfolio, complete the <a href="https://pages.wustl.edu/transferportfolio" target="_blank">Portfolio Eligibility Form</a>.
<br />
<br />
If you are not eligible to submit a portfolio, plan to take College Writing 1 in your first year of study.
<br />
<br />
If you are eligible to submit a portfolio, you will be redirected to a webpage that allows you to submit a writing portfolio for our review.  On this page you will provide information about your previous course and writing samples from it (see below for details).  If you cannot submit your portfolio online, please contact our office.
  </p>
  <hr />

  <h3>Deadline</h3>
  <p>
    If you are deemed eligible, the deadline to submit a writing portfolio is August 1.  Students who miss this deadline will be required to take College Writing 1 in their first year of study.
  </p>

  <hr />
  <h3>Portfolio Contents</h3>
  <p>
    Portfolios should include 3-5 analytical, argumentative essays (minimum of 4 pages each) from previous college coursework, including one researched essay, and a brief description of the original assignment / goals for each essay submitted. Essays should be ones written for college (preferably writing) courses. They should have analytical or argumentative thesis statements; use evidence to support claims; integrate and cite researched sources responsibly; and engage critically with sources. (The following items should not be submitted: responses to essay examinations, personal or creative writing, book reviews, journalism articles, response papers, or writing done during high school.) Where possible, essays should not be marked or graded; grades received in previous courses have no bearing on the portfolio review process.
  </p>
<hr />
  <h3>Additional Information</h3>
  <p>
    If you do not have a complete portfolio, you should contact the College Writing Program as soon as possible, by phone at (314) 935-4899 or by email at collegewriting@wustl.edu. In most cases, students who do not have complete portfolios are required to take College Writing 1. International students transferring from outside the U.S. will be required to take a Placement Exam in lieu of submitting a portfolio. International students transferring within the U.S. may also be required to take a Placement Exam, in addition to the portfolio review process.
