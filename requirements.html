  <h1>University Writing Requirement</h1>
  <h3>College Writing Program</h3>
  <p>
    The College Writing Program acknowledges the considerable existing strengths of
     writers coming to Washington University and is designed to extend those
     strengths, inviting students to become more thoughtful, efficient,
     and nuanced writers of academic and professional prose.
      In its largest sense, the course College Writing 1 (L59 100)
      is about how writers use language to generate original ideas and
      how they deploy those ideas to influence specific audiences.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h3>Preparatory Courses for College Writing 1</h3>
  <p>
    In certain instances, students may be required to complete preparatory
     coursework prior to taking College Writing 1 and may be placed into
      either 1511 or 1001. Students placed in one of the preparatory courses
       must successfully complete that course (by earning a C- or better)
       and the course that follows (if applicable) in order, in successive
       semesters before they may take College Writing 1. Only satisfactory
       performance in the course (earning a C- or better) will fulfill the
       first year writing requirement.
  </p>

  <h3>AP/IB Test Scores</h3>
  <h4>Policy for Architecture, Art, Arts & Sciences, and Business</h4>
  <p>
    Test scores cannot exempt students from taking L59-100. Students entering the university with an AP score of 5 or an IB score of 7, and who earn a B or better in 100, satisfy the writing requirement as well as receive 3 elective back-credits, which count toward graduation. Students who have a 5 on the AP test or a 7 on the IB test, and who receive a B- or below in L59-100, satisfy the writing requirement but do not receive additional elective credits. Students are encouraged to verify that their AP or IB score has been communicated to the university and that it appears on their record. Contact the Office of Student Records with any questions.
  </p>
  <h4>Policy for Engineering Students</h4>
  <p>
    Students in Engineering should consult School of Engineering and Applied Sciences <a href="http://bulletin.wustl.edu/engineering/requirements/">Writing Requirement.</a>
