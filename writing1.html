  <h1>College Writing 1 FAQs</h1>
  <h3>Who enrolls in College Writing 1?</h3>
  <p>
In the schools of Architecture, Art, Arts & Sciences, and Business, all students who enter as freshmen must complete College Writing 1 to satisfy the University’s Writing Requirement. Additionally, some transfer students may be required to enroll in the course. (Engineering has its own policy for how students satisfy the Writing Requirement; in many cases, Engineering students are required to enroll in College Writing 1. To find out more about Engineering’s requirement, contact the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at 314-935-5463.)
  </p>
  <h3>  I don’t know much about College Writing 1. When is it offered? How big are the classes?</h3>
  <p>

    All College Writing 1 sections (with the exception of those linked to the Text & Tradition program) are held on MWF, beginning at every hour of the day (except 11 a.m.) from 8 a.m. until 3 p.m. The sections are kept at a very low enrollment (12 students) in an effort to maintain small writing communities.


  </p>
  <h3>Is College Writing 1 a literature course?</h3>
  <p>
    No – in fact, students are sometimes surprised to find that work in class focuses less on discussion of the readings’ content and more on the particular strategies the writers of those texts have employed. Our goal in examining written texts in this way is to increase students’ awareness of the wide variety of choices open to them as writers, and to empower them to make new and more informed choices in their own writing. In College Writing 1, we work with texts from a variety disciplines, and we consider the ways in which a text’s situation in a particular discipline informs its construction.


  </p>
  <h3>I’ve heard that College Writing 1 sections are “standardized.” What does that mean?</h3>
  <p>
    All College Writing 1 sections (with the exception of those sections linked to first-year programs) share standard curricular elements, including course objectives, grade weights, and policies; course books; major assignments; major concepts; and deadlines for the final research project. Additionally, every section will be assigned a class reference librarian. (These shared elements provide the backbone of the course, and using them, individual instructors design their own syllabi, making decisions about such things as which of the shared readings to assign (and when), how much homework to assign, and when major assignments are due.)


  </p>
  <h3>What kinds of things will we do in College Writing 1? What kinds of essays will we write?</h3>
  <p>
    In College Writing 1, the writing you do in class is as important as the writing you do outside of class. Class time is often spent on exercises designed to help you practice new writing strategies, experiment with alternative writing strategies, and prepare to write longer assignments. You will write formal, argumentative essays, but you will also spend time on shorter, less-formal and more-process-oriented writing. Additionally, you will work on a research project, through which you'll learn the academic conventions of scholarship at the university.


  </p>
  <h3>I know that I must earn a C- or better in this class to satisfy the University Writing Requirement. What happens if I don’t?</h3>
  <p>
    By and large, students pass College Writing 1 with at least a C-. However, in cases where they don’t, students are usually required to re-take the course the following semester.


  </p>
  <h3>I’ve heard that this course is the only course on campus not taught by faculty. Is that true? Is it taught exclusively by graduate students?</h3>
  <p>
    No. There are lots of classes on campus that are not taught by faculty, and the College Writing Program employs a range of instructors. While there are graduate students (from English and from other departments) who teach College Writing 1, we also have part- and full-time lecturers, senior lecturers, post-doctoral fellows, and occasionally, members of the English Department faculty teaching the course. All instructors are trained to teach writing, and all are well-supported and -supervised.


  </p>
  <h3>I notice that no instructor names are listed for College Writing 1 on WebSTAC. Why can’t I select my class based on who the instructor is?</h3>
  <p>
    Given the challenges of staffing so many classes and finding seats for so many students each year, it simply isn’t possible to allow students to enroll by instructor.


  </p>
  <h3>I am a freshman who has already done a lot of writing; I even did well on standardized tests (e.g., SAT, AP, IB). Why do I have to take this course?</h3>
  <p>
    Despite its number at the 100-level, College Writing 1 is not a remedial course, nor is it an introduction to writing. In fact, it is designed for students just like you: well-prepared, competent writers who are ready to be challenged to write differently and think more analytically for this new writing situation.


  </p>
  <h3>Even though standardized tests can’t place me out of College Writing 1, I would like to get credit for my AP or IB score. Can I?</h3>
  <p>
    Maybe. It depends on your test score and your final grade in College Writing 1. If you earned a 5 on the AP exam or a 7 on the IB exam and if you earn a B or better in College Writing 1, you will earn 3 elective back-credits toward graduation. Please note: If, after you have completed the course, you don’t see these credits listed on your planner, please contact the registrar for your school.
