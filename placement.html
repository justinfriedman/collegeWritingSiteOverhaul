  <h1>Writing Placement Exam</h1>
  <p>
    The Writing Placement Exam may be recommended to or required for certain students to ensure that they are adequately prepared for the challenges of College Writing 1 (L59 100), the University’s first-year writing requirement. Our sole objective in recommending/requiring this exam is to ensure that all students who take College Writing 1 have the skills and support they need to do well in the class.
<br />
<br />
Students are recommended/required to take this exam for a variety of reasons (e.g., English language status, standardized test scores, recommendations from a program or academic advisor, etc.). In most cases, students who take the exam place directly into College Writing 1 and take College Writing 1 during their first semester of study. If, however, the student's exam indicates that he or she would benefit from a preparatory writing course, he or she will be required to complete that course first semester in order to prepare for College Writing 1. Once he or she has completed the exam, and we have determined the appropriate course placement, he or she will be allowed to finalize fall registration. <b>Please note: </b>Students who are required to take the exam and who fail to attend the exam will be automatically enrolled in the lowest preparatory course in the sequence and will not be allowed to attend College Writing 1 on the first day of fall classes.
  </p>

  <h3>The Exam</h3>
  <p>
    The Writing Placement Exam is a timed writing exam that asks students to produce one essay in response to a short reading. Students will also complete a self-assessment form, on which they can provide some contextual information about their previous training in writing, strengths and weaknesses, etc. The Writing Placement Exam will be administered online with an invitation arriving by email by June 1. For exam instructions, <a href="https://collegewriting.wustl.edu/files/collegewriting/imce/wustl_writing_placement_exam_instructions_fl15.pdf" target="_blank">click here</a>. If students miss the online opportunity, the Writing Placement Exam will be administered on campus twice. <b>The early exam will be on Thursday, August 13, from 1:30 p.m. to 3:45 p.m. in Seigle Hall, Room L006.</b> If students are arriving early to campus, we encourage them to go ahead and take the exam at this time. <b>The second exam will be during Orientation on Friday, August 21, from 8:00 a.m. to 10:15 a.m.  in Duncker Hall, Room 101.</b>

  <h3>Writing Placement Exam FAQs</h3>
  <h4>I have received a letter of recommendation to take the WPE. Do I have to take the exam?</h4>
  <p>
    No – if you have received a recommendation to take the WPE, you are not required to the take the exam. However, taking the exam assures that you are placed in the most appropriate writing course. If you do not take the WPE, the College Writing Program has safeguards against improper placement. First, all writing instructors will administer a writing diagnostic in the first week and consult with us if they feel any student needs additional support. Second, you are always welcome to discuss with your instructor or Program administration your placement. If you feel that a preparatory placement would better serve your writing needs this semester and for the rest of your coursework at Wash U, then we will place you accordingly.
  </p>

  <h4>If I am not happy with my WPE decision, may I retake the exam?</h4>
  <p>
    Yes. If you take the exam online over the summer, you may retake the exam on campus before classes begin. If you take only the on-campus exam, your instructor will provide us with feedback on your writing diagnostic, which you will complete in the first week of the semester.
