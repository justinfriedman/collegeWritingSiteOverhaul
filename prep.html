  <h1>Preparatory Writing Course Sequence</h1>
  <p>
    Before taking College Writing 1, some students may be required or recommended to take one or more preparatory courses. For second-language writers, we sometimes require a course in English Language Programs (ELP). Any student may be required or recommended to take a preparatory composition course before taking College Writing 1, perhaps along with an ELP tutorial. Students placed in preparatory courses must successfully complete those courses by earning a C+ or better in successive semesters before they may take College Writing 1. The following list describes each of these preparatory courses. To find out when these courses are offered, consult <a href="https://acadinfo.wustl.edu/WebSTAC.asp" target="_blank">online course listings.</a>

  <h3>U15 (ELP) 1511, Critical Reading and Analytical Writing</h3>
  <p>
    This course focuses on developing the reading and writing skills needed to excel at the college level. Students apply principles of logical argumentation in order to critically read argumentative writing. They then develop analytical essays in response to these arguments. Students write four main papers of two drafts apiece. At the same time, the course addresses the clarity and accuracy of students' written English through ample written feedback, occasional lessons devoted to language issues common among course participants, and occasional individual tutorial meetings. To ensure that all students achieve strong reading and writing skills, the University requires undergraduate students to pass U15 ELP 1511 with a C- or better. Students who receive a D+ or lower are required to retake the course and earn a C- or better before advancing to the next course in the sequence. For more information, visit the<a href="http://oiss.wustl.edu/english-language-programs/" target="_blank"> English Language Programsâ€™ (ELP) website</a> or contact the ELP at <a href="elp@wustl.edu">elp@wustl.edu</a>.

  <h3>L59 1001, Fundamentals of Academic Writing</h3>
  <p>
    This course is required of some students before they take College Writing 1 (L59 100) (placement to be determined by the department).  Students explore various aspects of the writing process, attending to matters of style and developing their skills of analysis and critique.  They consider the choices writers make in relation to audience and purpose and examine the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of various argumentative strategies.  Particular attention is paid to reading comprehension, critical thinking, and organization of ideas.  The course does not by itself satisfy the University Writing Requirement, and must be taken for a letter grade. Credit 3 units.

  <p>
